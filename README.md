"But first, coffee!"

Office workers usually grab a coffee before starting a long day work. I am no exception.
I create a coffee board to make clerks' workflow smoother.
When the clerks get an offer, they may easily tap on the screen. Certain item adds to the board.
If the trade is done, tap on the screen again, then the task may disappear.
